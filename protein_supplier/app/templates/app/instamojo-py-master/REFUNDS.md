**Note**: If you're using this wrapper with our sandbox environment `https://test.instamojo.com/` then you should pass `'https://test.instamojo.com/api/1.1/'` as third argument to the `Instamojo` class while initializing it. API key and Auth token for the same can be obtained from https://test.instamojo.com/developers/ (Details: [Test Or Sandbox Account](https://instamojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/208485675-Test-or-Sandbox-Account)).

### Create a new Refund

    from instamojo_wrapper import Instamojo
    api = Instamojo(api_key=API_KEY,

    # Create a new Refund
    response = api.refund_create(
        payment_id='MOJO5c04000J30502939',
        type="QFL",
        body="Customer is not satisfied.")

    # print the unique ID(or Refund ID)
    print response['refund']['id']
    # print the status
    print response['refund']['status']

### Get the details of a Refund

    from instamojo_wrapper import Instamojo

                    auth_token=AUTH_TOKEN)

    # Create a new Payment Request
    response = api.refund_detail(REFUND_ID)

    print response['refund']['status']  # Get the status

    from instamojo_wrapper import Instamojo
    api = Instamojo(api_key=API_KEY,
                    auth_token=AUTH_TOKEN)

    # Create a new Payment Request
    response = api.refunds_list()

    # Loop over all of the Refunds and print their status
    for refund in response['refunds']:
        print refund['status']

## Available Refund Functions

 * `refund_create(payment_id, type, body)` => Refund
 * `refund_detail(id)` => Refund
 * `refunds_list()` => List of Refunds

## Refund Creation Parameters

### Required
  * `payment_id`: Payment ID for which Refund is being requested.
  * `type`: A three letter short-code to identify the type of the refund. Check the
            REST docs for more info on the allowed values.
  * `body`: Additional explanation related to why this refund is being requested.

### Optional
  * `refund_amount`: This field can be used to specify the refund amount. For instance, you
            may want to issue a refund for an amount lesser than what was paid. If
            this field is not provided then the total transaction amount is going to
            be used.
